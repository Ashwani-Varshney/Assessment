# Assessment
This repository consists of my solution to the given assessment.\n
I have used the non-class (freestyle modular) approach to the problem. 
I understand there might be multiple implications and meaning of the problem statement(s) 
but I have done the assessment as per my best understanding of the techniques and data. 
Thank you for the opportunity, I hope you like my solution.
